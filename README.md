# DabazNX
DABAX and DABAM in hdf5/nexus format (z=x,m)

## Purpose
This project contains tools aiming to make common standard formats for data useful in synchrotron beamlines

Currently we are looking to move to HDF5/NEXUS format data from 

- DABAM (DAta BAse for Metrology)  http://ftp.esrf.eu/pub/scisoft/dabam/readme.html http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S1600577516005014

- DABAX (DAta BAse for X-rays) http://ftp.esrf.eu/pub/scisoft/DabaxFiles/



Other tools of interest: 

- SYNED (SYNchrotron Element Dictionary): containers to represent the beamline elements ( https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2274232 https://github.com/oasys-kit/syned)
